# Contributing to the Industrial Organism

Thank you for your interest in evolving **GAMESA/KrystalStack**. We are not just writing code; we are architecting biological systems for silicon hardware.

## 🌱 How to Contribute

### 1. The Philosophy
Before submitting code, ask yourself:
*   Does this maximize **economic utility**? (Does it save resources or make them tradable?)
*   Is it **biologically resilient**? (Does it handle failure gracefully, like a reflex?)
*   Is it **safe**? (Does it respect the "Spinal Reflex" limits?)

### 2. Branching Strategy
We use semantic branching to denote evolutionary steps:
*   `evolution/feature-name` (New features)
*   `mutation/bug-fix` (Bug fixes)
*   `adaptation/performance` (Optimization)

### 3. Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create your branch (`git checkout -b evolution/my-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
4.  Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request.
5.  **The Architects Council** will review your code for safety and biological alignment.

## 🧪 Testing
All submissions must pass the **Safety Contracts**.
```bash
# Run the safety validation suite
python -m src.python.guardian --verify-contracts
```

## 📜 Legal
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's **MIT License** for the Core, while acknowledging the commercial boundaries of the Enterprise Nexus.
