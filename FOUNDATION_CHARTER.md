# The KrystalStack Foundation Charter

## 1. Mission Statement
**To evolve global computing infrastructure from static machinery into adaptive, economic industrial organisms.**

The KrystalStack Foundation exists to steward the development of the GAMESA protocols, ensuring they remain open, safe, and universally accessible, while fostering a sustainable ecosystem for commercial innovation.

## 2. Core Values
1.  **Safety First**: The "Organism" must never harm the host hardware. Physical safety constraints are immutable.
2.  **Open Evolution**: The core genetic code of optimization must remain open source to allow global collaboration.
3.  **Economic Rationality**: Compute resources are scarce; their usage must be economically optimized.
