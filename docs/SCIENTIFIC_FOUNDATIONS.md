# Scientific Foundations

## 1. The Theory of Industrial Organisms
We map biological and physical principles to computer science.

### A. Homeostasis (Control Theory)
Just as a body maintains 37°C regardless of weather, KrystalStack maintains optimal **Thermal/Performance Equilibrium**.
- **Equation**: `Efficiency = work / (heat × cost)`
- **Mechanism**: PID controllers modulated by "Amygdala Factors" (Risk tolerance).

### B. Neuro-Plasticity (Reinforcement Learning)
The system rewires itself based on experience.
- **Hebbian Learning**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together."
- **Application**: If two memory blocks are frequently accessed together, the 3D Grid moves them to adjacent coordinates.

## 2. Economic Physics
We treat computational resources as scarce physical goods.
- **Supply & Demand**: When VRAM is scarce, the "price" goes up, forcing low-priority background processes to "sell" their memory or hibernate.
- **The Great Translation**: Mapping business metrics to physics.
    - `Churn` ≈ `Mechanical Wear`
    - `CAC` ≈ `Setup/Initialization Time`

## 3. Formal Methods (The "Laws of Physics")
To prevent the "Organism" from going rogue, we use **Safety Contracts**.
- **Invariants**: Conditions that must ALWAYS be true (e.g., `Power < Max_Rated_Wattage`).
- **Pre-Conditions**: Must be met before an action starts.
- **Post-Conditions**: Verified after action completes.

> *"The system is allowed to evolve, but it is not allowed to break the laws of physics."*
